abstract: In this study, an interfacial biosensing scheme with ultra-precision
  is proposed. The scheme uses weak measurement techniques to ensure ultra-high
  sensitivity of the sensing system while improving the stability of the system
  through self-referencing and pixel point averaging, thus achieving ultra-high
  detection accuracy of biological samples. In specific experiments, we have
  used the biosensor in this study to perform specific binding reaction
  experiments for protein A and Mouse IgG with a detection line of 2.71 ng/mL
  for IgG. In addition, the sensor is non-coated, simple in structure, easy to
  operate, and low in cost of use.
